# Contributing guidelines

> [!NOTE]
> This is a small library and I would like to keep it so.

Feel free to open a PR with a bugfix or a new feature and make sure you have

1. Unit tests,
2. Docstrings,
3. If necessary update readme.

Please ask yourself before implementing a large feature if this library needs it.

Cheers.
